            <h1>Elephant</h1><br>
            <p></p>
            <p>Elephants are the largest existing land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: the
                African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. They are an informal
                grouping within the proboscidean family Elephantidae. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of
                proboscideans; extinct members include the mastodons. Elephantidae also contains several extinct groups,
                including the mammoths and straight-tusked elephants. African elephants have larger ears and concave
                backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears, and convex or level backs. The distinctive features of
                all elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, massive legs, and tough
                but sensitive skin. The trunk is used for breathing, bringing food and water to the mouth, and grasping
                objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving
                objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in
                communication. The pillar-like legs carry their great weight.
                <br>
            <p>
                Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia and are found in
                different habitats, including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. They are herbivorous, and they
                stay near water when it is accessible. They are considered to be keystone species, due to their impact
                on their environments. Elephants have a fissionâ€“fusion society, in which multiple family groups come
                together to socialise. Females (cows) tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female
                with her calves or several related females with offspring. The groups, which do not include bulls, are
                usually led by the oldest cow, known as the matriarch.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Males (bulls) leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males.
                Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate. They enter a state of increased
                testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance over other males as well as
                reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their
                mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by
                touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use infrasound, and seismic communication over long distances.
                Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans. They appear to have
                self-awareness, and appear to show empathy for dying and dead family members.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                African bush elephants and Asian elephants are listed as endangered and African forest elephants as
                critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). One of the biggest
                threats to elephant populations is the ivory trade, as the animals are poached for their ivory tusks.
                Other threats to wild elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people. Elephants
                are used as working animals in Asia. In the past, they were used in war; today, they are often
                controversially put on display in zoos, or exploited for entertainment in circuses. Elephants are highly
                recognisable and have been featured in art, folklore, religion, literature, and popular culture. </p>
