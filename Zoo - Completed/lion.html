            <h1>Lion</h1>
            <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a
                muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail.
                It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a
                social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related
                females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The
                lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have
                been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not.</p>
<p>
                The lion inhabits grasslands, savannas and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats,
                but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period,
                the lion ranged throughout Africa, Southeast Europe, the Caucasus, and Western and South Asia, but it
                has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It
                has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries
                have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated
                protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts
                with humans are the greatest causes for concern.</p>
            <p>
                One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively
                depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions
                have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for
                exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions of
                lions were prominent in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and
                medieval cultures in the lion's historic and current range. !</p>
